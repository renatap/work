                            What would you do if you moved to a different city and wanted to dance Forró? In the Forró community, we often hear how difficult it is to keep track of what’s happening, especially if you’re new. 
</p><p class="beispiele">
As part of the efforts in providing support for the community professionals, the European Forró Federation wanted to first find out more about the work of people who publish events and curate event listings. This in the context in which I was invited to take over this Research project.

As a volunteer, I am currently researching event publishing and event list curation in the community. The project involves <b>qualitative and quantitative</b> research, as well as a <b>workshop</b> and presentation to stakeholders.</p>

            <p class="beispiele">In this study that was part of my Master's course work, Amanda Magalhães and I analyzed a phone model produced by Brazilian company Intelbras to first find out if it fulfills the principles of <b>Universal Design</b>. Following that, we used the <b>semantic differential</b> method to compare the perception of the phone design between younger and older participants. In this method, participants are asked to rate the design based on adjective pairs - old/new, light/heavy, and so on. 
                
            </p>
            <p class="beispiele"> We concluded that the product does follow Universal Design principles. After statistical analysis of the semantic differential surveys we also concluded that the design of the phone we tested made a good impression in both groups, with few differences being significant.

            <p class="beispiele">During my master’s studies in Design, I planned and conducted a <b>usability test</b> for the sewing pattern magazine BurdaStyle, together with colleagues and professors. Our goal was to find out if it could be used by sewing <b></b>beginners</b>, and if there were any obstacles for them. 
            </p>
            <p class="beispiele">
                In our own lab setup, we had 12 participants try out 3 tasks that simulated the real use of the product. We collected <b>qualitative and quantitative data</b> on task completion rates, time on task, number of errors per task, comments, among others. After analysis, we concluded that there are many obstacles for beginners, such as specialized terms, lack of clear instructions, and too much information in a single pattern sheet, and also wrote recommendations.

            <p class="beispiele">

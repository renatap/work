        <p class="beispiele">Sparkly is a course project I completed while doing the UX Research and Strategy course at
            Design Lab. I chose to do research and design the concept of an app that would help people who live in a
            shared flat organize chores and cleaning tasks. As part of the course curriculum, we would start with
            <b>exploratory research</b> and work our way to designing <b>user flows</b> and a landing page. I worked on this project
            with the help of a course mentor. <a href="sparkly.html">See more about the project ></a></p>

            </p><br>
        <p class="beispiele">Due to an NDA, I can't go into more detail, but since 2021 I've been conducting <b>research and user tests</b> on Fit Finder and other <a href="http://ares.snap.com">Snap owned e-commerce solutions</a> in collaboration with a team of designers. 
            I've worked with Fit Finder since 2019, when I joined the company to be part of the Database Specialist team before switching to UX Research.</p>

            <p><h3>Study on the perception of an inclusive phone design</h3><h6>2015</h6></p><br>
            <p><img

                alt="Two bar charts demonstrating results of the semantic differential survey for word pairs 'technological/rudimentary' and 'traditional/modern'"></a>
            </p>
            <p class="beispiele">In this study that was part of my Master's course work, Amanda Magalhães and I analyzed a phone model produced by Brazilian company Intelbras to first find out if it fulfills the principles of <b>Universal Design</b>. Following that, we used the <b>semantic differential</b> method to compare the perception of the phone design between younger and older participants. In this method, participants are asked to rate the design based on adjective pairs - old/new, light/heavy, and so on. 
                
            </p>
            <p class="beispiele"> We concluded that the product does follow Universal Design principles. After statistical analysis of the semantic differential surveys we also concluded that the design of the phone we tested made a good impression in both groups, with few differences being significant.

                <p><h3>Usability Test of BurdaStyle</h3><h6>2014</h6></p>

                alt="BurdaStyle pattern sheet"></a>
            </p>
            <p class="beispiele">During my master’s studies in Design, I planned and conducted a <b>usability test</b> for the sewing pattern magazine BurdaStyle, together with colleagues and professors. Our goal was to find out if it could be used by sewing <b></b>beginners</b>, and if there were any obstacles for them. 
            </p>
            <p class="beispiele">
                In our own lab setup, we had 12 participants try out 3 tasks that simulated the real use of the product. We collected <b>qualitative and quantitative data</b> on task completion rates, time on task, number of errors per task, comments, among others. After analysis, we concluded that there are many obstacles for beginners, such as specialized terms, lack of clear instructions, and too much information in a single pattern sheet, and also wrote recommendations.
            </p>
            <p class="beispiele">
                As a result of this study, we wrote a paper that was presented and published in the 15o ERGODESIGN and USIHC. You can read the <a href="https://www.proceedings.blucher.com.br/article-details/19050" target="new">paper in full here</a>. (In Portuguese)

In this article I share a technique I came up with, based on one described in “The User Experience Team of One”, by Leah Buley. It's a small <b>workshop</b> that can be done synchronously or asynchronously. <a href="research-questions.html">Read the article ></a></p>

        <p class="flag">Introducing...Sparkly</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        </p><br>
        <p class="beispiele">Sparkly is a course project I completed while doing the UX Research and Strategy course at
            Design Lab. I chose to do research and design the concept of an app that would help people who live in a
            shared flat organize chores and cleaning tasks. As part of the course curriculum, we would start with
            exploratory research and work our way to designing user flows and a landing page. I worked on this project
            with the help of a course mentor.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        </p><br>
        <p class="beispiele">When people live together, house chores are sometimes a source of conflict. What has to be
            done, by whom, and how often can cause some stress around the house, and asking housemates to keep up with
            their share of the work can be uncomfortable. Furthermore, some people might be just starting to take
            responsibility for their living environment and still unsure of how to go about it. </p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            For professionals with work responsibilities and limited time for personal tasks and leisure, having an
            efficient, stress-free way of organizing shared tasks and avoiding conflict can be very valuable. With the
            initial exploratory research, I aimed to find out what are the opportunities for a house tasks sharing app
            that makes collaborating with housemates an easier and smoother experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Research goal</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Find out what problems working people between 30 and 38 years old face when trying to coordinate house
            chores, and what tools are currently used and could be improved.</p></p>
        <p>
        <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">
            People who live in a shared flat face personal and interpersonal stress due to difficulties coordinating
            house chores, and would benefit from an app that could help them.</p></p>
        <p>
        <h4>Research questions</h4>
        <ul class="questions">
            <li>
                How do professionals who share a home go about deciding what house chores need to be done?</li>
            <li>How do they decide who will do what?
                How do they plan and follow their schedules?</li>
            <li>Are there any problems that happen during this process?</li>
            <li>What parts of the process are the most difficult or cause stress?</li>
            <li>How does communication between housemates go and is this ever a source of conflict?</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Defining a target audience was the first challenge I faced while working on this project. In the review I
            got from my mentor, she suggested I consider the socioeconomic status of my audience - professional people
            will be more likely to pay for an app, and if I target students I might need to think about advertisement to
            make this sustainable.</p></p>

        <p>
        <h3>Work</h3>
        <h4>Research Plan</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">
            According to our schedule and the project budget ($0), I decided to conduct semi-structured one-on-one
            interviews with 3 people who currently share a home with one or more people. Exploratory interviews are a
            useful and relatively quick way to get qualitative data and understand the user's point of view.</p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Although I had initially planned to confirm the findings of the interviews with a Survey, I had to skip that
            step because of the short deadline.</p></p>
        <p>
        <h4>Recruiting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Age 30-38;</li>
            <li>Work full time and are financially independent;</li>
            <li>Don’t have children;</li>
            <li>Live in Europe;</li>
            <li>Share a home with one or more people they are not related to;</li>
            <li>Don’t use cleaning services.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>
        <h4>Analysis Overview</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">
            As part of the course curriculum, there were a few different synthesis methods we should use. I included a
            few more to get good practice on how to make them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Affinity diagramming</li>
            <li>Empathy maps</li>
            <li>Personas</li>
            <li>Storyboards</li>
            <li>Customer Journey Maps</li>
            <li>Feature Matrix</li>
            <li>Point of View Statements</li>
            <li>How Might We Statements</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">
            After getting a good understanding of the users, I used a few methods to come up with an app design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crazy Eights</li>
            <li>
                User flows</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>
        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">With the user flows in hand, I drafted assumptions for a learning canvas, as well as a
            landing page to test the concept.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning Canvas</li>
            <li>
                Landing Page</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>
        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">I performed a few tests in order to check if I was on track with the app design.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Landing page test</li>
            <li>
                Storyboard review</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>
        <h3>End Result</h3></p>
        <p>
        <h4>Interview results</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">I learned so much from the interviews. Here are some highlights: </p></p>

        <div class="details">
            <p>
            <h6>Communication</h6>
            <p>Communication between flatmates can be a source of stress - people feel uncomfortable reminding others
                about their responsibilities, and sometimes it can result in disagreements. Also, messages can get lost
                in the messaging app groups. Sometimes requests come in inappropriate times and in a passive-aggressive
                way.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
            <h6>Tools</h6>
            <p>Spreadsheets commonly used for cleaning schedules are difficult to work with on a phone. People also
                don’t know when it’s up to date when flatmates swapped cleaning dates, for example. Flatmate agreements
                are not always effective. </p>
            </p>

            <p>
            <h6>Coordination</h6>
            <p>Some feel constrained with a cleaning schedule, but it’s also difficult to coordinate synchronous
                cleaning days. </p>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="beispiele">After interviewing 3 people, I felt that I still didn’t have the whole story. Everyone I
            interviewed seemed to be responsible with their cleaning tasks, but no one really struggled with it. So I
            decided I needed to interview more people to get the whole picture. </p>

        <p class="beispiele">After interviewing one more person, I was much more satisfied with the results. What I
            learned from this interview would help me create a product that works for those who don’t like to clean too,
            or have difficulty doing it - possibly those who need it the most. </p>

        <p>
        <h4>Research Synthesis</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">Since the interview was exploratory, there was a large volume of data to analyze. Even with
            only the first 3 interviews, I had 150 data points.</p>

        <p class="beispiele">With affinity diagramming, I organized the data points into categories.</p></p>

        <p>
        <h5>Empathy maps</h5>
        <p class="beispiele">Here the different personas were starting to take shape. It became clear that there were
            different personalities and approaches to tackling house chores. I identified 3 personas.</p></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/empathymap.png?raw=true"><img
                    src="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/empathymap.png?raw=true" class="image"
                    alt="Empathy Map for persona Johanna"></a></p>
        <p class="beispiele">The defining difference between the first 2 personas is that one of them likes to have
            everything planned, and the other likes to be spontaneous. Both of them are concerned with having a clean
            living space, and want their housemates to do their part.</p>
        <p class="beispiele">Both of them are uncomfortable about asking others to do more. Persona 2 is more okay with
            being asked, because they are already doing things more spontaneously. Persona 1 doesn't like to be asked
            because they have everything planned out already, and feel that they are doing everything right.</p>
        <p class="beispiele">Persona 3, on the other hand, has some trouble keeping on top of their tasks. As much as
            she wants to collaborate and have a good relationship with everyone, she is often seen as lazy and
            irresponsible. One of her biggest obstacles when it comes to getting things done is feeling overwhelmed and
            unmotivated.</p>

        <p>
        <h5>Personas</h5>
        <p class="beispiele">After doing the empathy maps, it was easier to work on the persona cards and really make
            their personalities come to life.</p></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/persona1.png?raw=true"><img
                    src="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/persona1.png?raw=true" class="image"
                    alt="Persona Johanna"></a></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/persona2.png?raw=true"><img
                    src="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/persona2.png?raw=true" class="image"
                    alt="Persona Lucas"></a></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/persona3.png?raw=true"><img
                    src="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/persona3.png?raw=true" class="image"
                    alt="Persona Luisa"></a></p>

        <p>
        <h5>Storyboards</h5>
        <p class="beispiele">In the storyboard, I synthesized some of the stories I heard in the interviews to make
            empathizing with the users even easier. Here, the focus was on the pain points some of them experienced when
            it comes to communicating about chores and getting them done.</p></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/storyboard-luisa.png?raw=true"><img
                    src="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/storyboard-luisa.png?raw=true" class="image"
                    alt="Storyboard for persona Luisa"></a></p>

        <p>
        <h5>User Journey Maps</h5>
        <p class="beispiele">In the user journey maps, I further delineated the persona’s experiences with cleaning
            tasks. Every step of their cleaning/communicating process was drilled down, so it became easy to see what
            the low and high points were. For Lucas, for example, asking his flatmates for help with chores was the most
            stressful part. For Johanna, starting her cleaning day and finding out that cleaning supplies were missing
            was one of the biggest sources of stress, as well as having to reschedule her plans because of that.</p></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/user-journey-lucas.png?raw=true"><img
                    src="https://github.com/renatap/work/blob/main/user-journey-lucas.png?raw=true" class="image"
                    alt="User Journey Map for persona Lucas"></a></p>

        <p>
        <h5>Feature Matrix</h5>
        <p class="beispiele">In the feature matrix, I analyzed the features of 3 competitor apps that are used to
            organize cleaning tasks or split shared flat costs: Tody, Sweepy, and Our Flat. I listed out all of their
            features and organized them in a cost x value matrix. </p>

        <p class="beispiele">Some of the highlights of the low cost and high value section, that would be paramount for
            us to include, were: </p>
        <ul class="features-essential">
            <li>customizable task list, per house areas; </li>
            <li>
                setting frequency of tasks;</li>
            <li>
                making tasks as done; </li>
            <li>
                allows customizing effort level for each task; </li>
            <li>
                allows assigning tasks for different participants; </li>
            <li>
                notifications for tasks that are due; </li>
            <li>
                achievements. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="beispiele">Some of the features that were considered high value and high cost, and could be a
            competitive advantage to have: </p>
        <ul class="features-competitive">
            <li>suggesting task frequency based on different cleaning expectations; </li>
            <li>
                allows multiple participants; </li>
            <li>
                splitting bills; </li>
            <li>
                integrated chat; </li>
            <li>
                generates daily schedule based on how much time the user has available.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="beispiele">This helped not only with finding out what functionality was essential for the app, but
            also how to set it apart from the competitors.
        </p></p>

        <p>
        <h5>How Might We's</h5>
        <p class="beispiele">I wrote Point of View statements about each persona’s experience with their needs and pain
            points. From that, I generated HMW statements to help guide my brainstorming sections, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How might we help Luisa be more motivated about cleaning activities?</li>
            <li>
                How might we help Lucas and his flatmates have a more balanced workload?</li>
            <li>
                How might we help young adults who share a flat communicate more easily about cleaning?</li>
            <li>
                How might we help young adults who share a flat reduce the need to ask flatmates to do
                something?</li>
            <li>
                How might we help Joanna coordinate cleaning expectations with her flatmates?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">Before brainstorming ideas for the app, I already knew I would like to tackle the
            motivation issue with gamification, and that the app should take up the burden of communication. So with the
            HMW’s on hand, I brainstormed different solutions for the problems using the Crazy Eights exercise (three
            times).</p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            After choosing the most promising ideas, I sketched user flows for several app functionalities. Especially
            important for me was to highlight how the sign up process would work - here people would answer a short
            questionnaire about their cleaning habits and preferences, so that we can come up with a schedule and task
            list that works for everyone involved. The challenge would be to keep it short enough that people would
            still be motivated to do it. I decided we could accomplish that by having predefined areas with related
            tasks, as well as with predefined cleaning frequency, that can be customized later as needed. </p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Another important one for this app was the task alert flow. I wanted it to be less intrusive as possible,
            and allow the user the freedom to reschedule and be reminded of a task when it’s more convenient. They have
            the option to select “I’ll do it” or “I can’t do it now”, as well as “I need help”.</p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            The app would also feature a beginner mode, with a sort of wizard that would help with step-by-step
            instructions for those who need the extra help and motivation.
        </p></p>

                    alt="User flow of Task Alert functionality"></a></p>

        <p>
        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">Before prototyping a landing page, I listed out assumptions that I might have based my
            design on, such as “Users would spend between 10-15 minutes doing app setup”. I then drafted a plan of how
            to eventually test these assumptions to make sure the app would be accepted.
        </p>

        <p class="beispiele">With all that in mind, I designed a landing page that would describe our product with an
            MVP set of features. The idea would be to test the concept with potential users, as well as the
            effectiveness of the page itself in communicating the value of the app and the main features. I had a lot of
            fun working on the copy to convey the message in a friendly, engaging tone. <a

            allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

        <p>
        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">I designed a qualitative test of the landing page to find out, especially, if the idea is
            clearly communicated, and what the target audience is. This was a moderated test in which two participants
            interacted with the landing page prototype, answered a few questions about it, and performed a couple of
            tasks.</p>

        <p class="beispiele">Some interesting findings were:</p>
        <ul class="testing">
            <li>The Download buttons were easy enough to find, and both participants found more than one instance.
                Likewise, the Pricing session was easily identified. Both participants understood who this app is meant
                for, and the basic idea behind it - collaboration, scheduling, task sharing.</li>
            <li>
                The idea that the app would help with communication and reduce stress between flatmates was also
                effectively communicated in the copy.</li>
            <li>
                The first participant, based on the illustrations, inferred that the app would help with exercising and
                work related tasks as well.</li>
            <li>
                Another participant commented that ‘the bathtub picture gave me the impression that the service can
                somehow measure how dirty the bathtub is’.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>
        <p class="beispiele">Based on these findings, I wrote the following recommendations:</p>
        </p>
        <ul class="recommendations">
            <li>Replace the exercise picture with a cleaning picture.</li>
            <li>
                The comment ‘the bathtub picture gave me the impression that the service can somehow measure how dirty
                the bathtub is’ was interesting, and maybe something that could be implemented with image recognition
                and machine learning, but for now, it might be better to tweak the illustration a bit so that potential
                users don’t get false expectations about the product.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        </p><br>
        <p class="beispiele">This was a fun project to make, but also challenging, as it was my first time using many of
            these tools. Some things didn’t go according to plan and I had to change my approach.</p>

        <p class="beispiele">I had initially planned to interview 3 people, but after starting to synthesize the data, I
            found out that I was missing the point of view of someone who struggles with their cleaning tasks. I decided
            to conduct another interview focusing on that type of user. I also had to skip the Survey step of the
            research due to time constraints. Conducting a survey would have helped me validate the findings of the
            interviews, since I only interviewed 4 people. </p>

        <p class="beispiele">Whenever possible, I would like to include more users in the research process to have the
            chance to cover more ground. According to <a
                href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interview-sample-size/">NN/group</a>, the sample size can be
            defined by when we reach saturation, which in turn depends on the target audience and research goals. The
            best approach, according to them, is to start small and analyze as we go, but some research studies have
            found that between 6 and 12 participants are enough. </p>

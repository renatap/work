        <p class="beispiele">One of the challenges I've faced since I started doing UX Research is getting my colleagues to be involved in the research process. In every research project there are opportunities for working together, not only getting support on tasks that may be outside of the scope of my role -  such as creating prototypes - but also getting input on research questions and interpretation of results. I think these two are especially important since people in my team are usually stakeholders of whatever I am researching.</p>
        <p class="beispiele">For creating research questions, I've done lots of research trying to find techniques that would help me invite my colleagues to collaborate. I am convinced that if I involve them and have diverse points of view, we will have a chance to cover all grounds and our results will be much better! </p>
        <p class="beispiele">In the case of testing an existing product, when it comes to research questions, I came up with a spin-off of a technique like described in “The User Experience Team of One”, by Leah Buley. It's a small workshop that can be done synchronously or asynchronously.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>List of requirements</h3><br><br><br>
        <p class="beispiele">
            To be able to run this successfully you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
Research goals</li><li>
Scope</li><li>
Prototype or finished product to be tested</li><li>
Collaboration tool (such as FigJam)</li><li>
A few stakeholders (I'd say from 3 to 8 people will work best)</li><li>
Around 30 min for preparation and up to 15 min for running the workshop.</li>
</p></p>
        <p>
        <h3>Preparation</h3><br><br><br>
        <p class="beispiele">
            First, I prepare a board on a collaboration tool (I'm using FigJam at the moment), and add 4 lanes. On the top lane, I add the screens of the product we want to test, sequentially. In case any interaction has to be tested, I'll add them too. On the following lanes, I add these questions:</p></p>

                alt="Example of board for creating research questions."></a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                “what do we need to know about this screen?” </li><li>
“what do we think the user might have a problem with?” </li><li>
“what assumptions are we making about the user?”
</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p class="beispiele">
            Then I add a few stickies to each as an example of how it can be filled out. If there is a specific goal to this test, I might write it out too, so that everyone is focused on it.</p>
            <p class="beispiele">  All of these questions can lead to similar answers, but I think that having them all spelled out might change perspective and spark new ideas. The objective here is to list out as many unknowns as we can think of. </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Action</h3><br><br><br>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Before the workshop starts, I explain the exercise and point out the research goals. During the exercise, I might give people 5 to 10 min to fill the lanes with stickies, depending on the size of the prototype. </p>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Tidying up</h3><br><br><br>
        <p class="beispiele">
            After we're done, I will start compiling these ideas and categorizing them so I can decide what to add to the research plan. I broke it down into a few steps:
        </p>
        <h4>1. Add questions to a spreadsheet and group them.</h4>
            <p class="beispiele">
                First I add all of them to a spreadsheet, one per row, eliminating duplicates.
                Then I group them based on topics. I have two main categories: general questions, and UI specific questions (first one is for subjective questions about the user that can apply to several screens or features. Second one refers to more specific UI issues).
                <p class="beispiele">
                    From that, I will categorize inside these main categories, with the first one leading to more abstract themes such as “lifestyle”, “trust”, “goals”, and the second one probably ending up being divided in screens or features.
                </p>

                    alt="Spreadsheets with research questions and categories"></a></p>
                <h4>2. Clean up</h4>
                <p class="beispiele">
I will take some time to evaluate the questions and scratch off any that are not relevant to the goals we had previously decided on.
</p><h4>
3. Designate methods</h4>
<p class="beispiele">
After grouping them, I create a column to write what kind of method I can use to find out the answers. Usually, there can be multiple methods that work, but I try to add only one per row, and I will choose the one that requires the least amount of resources.
</p>
<p class="beispiele">
    With that on hand, I can go back to the test plan, add the research questions I collected and organized, and start writing the test methods! Depending on how many different tests I would need, I will create extra research plans. 
</p>
            </p>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3><br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="beispiele">This should be a simple, quick, and fun way to involve your team in creating research questions. I really like how it allows me to involve different perspectives and make sure my colleagues can influence research from the start.</p>

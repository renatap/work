        <p class="beispiele">As part of the efforts in providing support for the community professionals, the European
            Forr√≥ Federation wanted to first find out more about the work of event promoters and event list curators.
            This in the context in which I was invited to take over this Research project.</p>

        <h6>Problem</h6>
        <p class="paragraph-highlights">Dancers can't keep track of events, and promoters can't reach their audience.
        </p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            What would you do if you moved to a different city and wanted to dance Forr√≥? In the Forr√≥ community, we
            often hear how difficult it is to keep track of what's happening, especially if you‚Äô're new.</p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Event postings are scattered across different platforms, and get lost in a sea of posts. Forr√≥ specific
            platforms exist, but haven‚Äôt been adopted by most promoters and dancers. So far, the community is divided
            and efforts to create consistency are done by key individuals in specific communities.
        </p>

        <p class="legend">A meme illustrating part of our problem: there is a Forr√≥ events specific app, but the
            community is not adopting it.
        </p>

        <h6>Goals</h6>
        <p class="paragraph-highlights">What we wanted to achieve</p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Together with the responsible board members, I defined the research goals and research questions, from which
            I developed a research plan that was later vetted by the Foundation.

        <h6>Challenges</h6>
        <p class="paragraph-highlights">A trade-off between deeper research and a more representative sample</p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Contextual inquiries in person would have been best for this, but having participants from all over Europe
            was also important, because each community works in a different way. We wouldn't be able to afford flying to
            different locations to meet all the participants, so we opted for doing interviews.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-highlights">User Journey Maps</p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Here, the challenge was finding a common thread between the stories of two different players: Event
            Promoters and Event Curators. I decided to synthesize these into two different maps, and to add <b>Dancers
                as touchpoints</b> - this was essential for some of the steps to make sense.
        </p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            In some cases, the interviewees' experiences were too plural to combine into one, as is the case of
            Curator's feelings when it comes to publishing lists. I kept them separate also as a way to illustrate how
            their experience can change based on which methods they use.

    <p class="beispiele">
        Through research, it became clear to us that creating a new app wouldn't solve their issues. They don't want to adopt new platforms if that doesn't mean they will have guaranteed reach right away. 
    </p><p class="beispiele">
        So our proposed solution is around being a hub where event info and dancers converge, through collaboration with Forr√≥ Ambassadors around Europe. Together we discussed the viability of this model, and how to make it work.

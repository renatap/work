        <p class="beispiele">During my time working at Fit Analytics - a Snap Company, I worked as a User Researcher on
            both SizeFox and Fit Finder. Because I have an NDA, I can’t show the work I did, but I would like to talk in
            more general lines about a few projects that I worked on.

        <h3>Sizefox</h3>

        <p class="beispiele">
            SizeFox is a sizing solution built for Shopify, which was launched in 2021. I worked on the app for a few
            months in 2022, specifically doing research for a new merchant-facing feature that was being built.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="beispiele">After briefing the team, I planned the entire research and design cycle of the feature,
            from the first steps up until final testing. Included in the plan were the steps we would take along the
            way, along with the rationale behind each of them, as well as a timeline estimation that fit the expected
            launch date. I chose to start with both a <b>survey</b>, to gauge wider interest in the feature, and <b>user
                interviews</b>, to learn in depth what merchants thought of the prototyped feature, and how was their
            experience
            using it. I also planned a second testing session to test the usability of the feature, in case there were
            major changes after the first round.
        </p>
        <h4>Presentation of Findings</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">
            After the first round of interviews, I create both a <b>written report</b> and a <b>slide deck</b> and
            present it to
            the entire team. While a written report contains all information about the methods and recruiting and the
            detailed results, it is usually more important for record keeping and for future reference. In my
            experience, colleagues usually don't read the entire report, so a more "friendly" reporting method is
            needed. I think that the slide deck is perfect for it. The format is flexible, and we already know a lot
            about how to create an engaging presentation and keep our colleagues' attention. I just make sure to include links
            to more detailed documentation in case anyone needs to reference it.
        </p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            In the presentation, I lead the discussions with the most important findings, and finish with the design recommendations.
            While presenting findings, I always keep the presentation open for questions and discussing the results, so
            that we can increase understanding and that we are on the same page with the design decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Something else I like to do is to work on the slide designs, since following design principles will increase
            legibility, understanding, and engagement. I add any visuals and graphs that are relevant to understand the
            information being shared, and when appropriate, a cool gif to keep the mood up!

        </p>
        <p class="beispiele">I am available to discuss more about the methodologies I use for research, my reasoning,
            and my approach, in general
            terms, on request.</p>

        <h3>FitFinder</h3>
        <p><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/sizefox-connect"><img

        <p class="beispiele">
            Fit Finder is the main sizing solution built by Fit Analytics. As described in <a
                href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABkJuIfbUf7C2YDl83DKfrrPaAM751TvjVhyEbEU10TS94Wrz-HTyVv-v6As0iOX0DvhA-XpmV9MP4oqvHiihaCrSACppTRWqhdpTNybxqsGNhsKDHZXgXzddhU_EAHksSglg2Wm92H-UcTPbBu59yzQ8hQfIxtRBorhQiOXy5vq">this
                article on TechCrunch</a>,
            “Fit Analytics’ technology lets people enter their own measurements into a tool that uses machine learning
            to match those dimensions up to the clothes or shoes in question to find the best fit.” As of 2021, Fit
            Finder served “a number of big retailers, including North Face, Asos, Calvin Klein, Patagonia, Puma, and
            many more”. </p>
        </p>

        <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">I lead research efforts to create a User Journey Map for Fit Finder, from planning research
            to delivering the final report. For this project, I did <b>user interviews</b> with several shoppers to
            understand
            more about their journey to find the right size when shopping online. One of our UX Designers and I designed
            the Map that represented that journey, and included results of our research, as well as data from our
            <b>analytics reports</b> and several other user tests we had done in previous projects. The resulting User
            Journey
            Map was presented to the entire company and continued to be referenced in following design decisions and
            research projects.
        </p>
        <h4>Investigation of Drop off Rates</h4>
        <p class="beispiele">
            To dig into possible UX causes of drop off rates, I crafted an investigation plan in which I collected and
            reviewed all relevant research that had already been conducted for Fit Finder, including:
        <ul>
            <li>
                User interview and testing rounds;
            </li>
            <li>
                Analytics data.
            </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Some of the possible causes were suggested in previous interview rounds, but the sample size was small.
            Because of that, I planned both a <b>survey</b> and an <b>automated user test</b> that would allow us to
            confirm or refute
            our initial hypotheses, as well as other research questions generated during the review.

        <p class="beispiele">During my time working at Fit Analytics - a Snap Company, I worked as a User Researcher on
            both SizeFox and Fit Finder. Because I have an NDA, I can’t show the work I did, but I would like to talk in
            more general lines about a few projects that I worked on.</p>

            <h5>The product</h5><p class="beispiele">
            Sizefox is a sizing solution built for Shopify, which was launched in 2021. There are two parts to Sizefox, a customer-facing app and a merchant-facing one. I worked on the app for a few
            months in 2022, specifically doing research for a new merchant-facing feature that was being built.</p></div>
        </p>
        
        <h6>Problem</h6>
        <p class="paragraph-highlights">Size recommendations were off for some merchants. Data Scientists conceptualized a new feature.</p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            Some merchant clients sent complaints that size recommendations were off, and requested to be able to adjust them. The data scientists in our team designed a feature that would solve this problem, but it has to be configured by users.
        </p>
        <h6>Questions</h6>
        <p class="paragraph-highlights">Would merchants understand this feature and be able to use it? </p>
        <p class="beispiele">
            The team's main goal was to find out if merchants would be able to understand the feature and use it. After briefing the team of Project Manager, Client Success, Data Scientists and Engineers, I raised another issue: would they event want this feature, in general, or was this an isolated request? 
        </p>
        <h6>Solution</h6>
        <p class="paragraph-highlights">We launched a survey and did moderated user tests of the feature. </p>

            alt="Comic illustrating the steps taken in this project: Planned research and design cycle, Survey to confirm wider interest, 
            Moderated user testing, Design changes, Second testing round."></a>
</p>
       
        <p class="beispiele">
            I planned the entire research and design cycle of the feature, from the first steps up until final testing. Included in the plan were the steps we would take along the way, along with the rationale behind each of them, as well as a timeline estimation that fit the expected launch date. </p>
            <p class="beispiele">
The feature was already being designed based on client requests, and I chose to start research with both a survey, to gauge wider interest in the feature, and moderated user tests, to learn in depth what merchants thought of the prototyped feature, and how was their experience using it. I also planned a second testing session to test the usability of the feature, in case there were major changes after the first round. This was cancelled due to changes in company priority.

            <p class="beispiele">
                I confirmed interest in the feature, and uncovered several usability issues. This impacted in design changes and improvements to the interface and user flow that would increase completion rate. The successful implementation of this feature would reduce complaints by 10%, and reduce return rates for our clients.</p>

            <h6>Problem</h6>
            <p class="paragraph-highlights">High Drop-off Rates</p>
            <p class="beispiele">
                One of the screens in the flow had much higher drop off rates than others, and insights from previous research were inconclusive.

    <li>Fit Finder UX can directly impact their clients’ <b>conversion rates.</b></li>
    <li>Previous studies that suggested drop off rate causes had <b>small samples.</b></li>

                I developed further research to find “whys” of the drop off rate, based on previous investigations, but this time with statistical significance. These are the steps I took:
